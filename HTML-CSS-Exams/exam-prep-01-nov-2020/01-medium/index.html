      <p class="right__desc">Medium is not like any other platform on the internet. <span>Our sole purpose is to help you find
        compelling ideas, knowledge, and perspectives.</span> We don’t serve ads—we serve you, the curious reader who loves to
        learn new things. Medium is home to thousands of independent voices, and we combine humans and technology to
        find
        the best reading for you—and filter out the rest.</p>
